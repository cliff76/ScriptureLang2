# ScriptureLang2
Recreation of scripture programming language.

ScriptureLang is my recreation of an idea from a buddy. It will eventually allow you to write code using Biblical King James version grammar. An example would be:

```
In the beginning
There was x;
Let there be y;
Thy x shall be 2;
Thy y shall be 3;
Thy answer shall be x + y;
Saith unto console answer;
Amen
```

The project is Java based and uses AntLR to generate a compiler/Lexer for the grammar.
